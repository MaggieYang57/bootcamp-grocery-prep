        <h1>About the Chef</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone! I'm Maggie Yang, a second-year Software Engineering student attending Cal Poly SLO.</p>
        <p>Although coding takes up the majority of my time and energy, I feel like good food should be a staple in everyone's daily life :^) 
            These recipes are copy-pasted from the Hack4Impact example website, so none of these are mine.</p>

        <h1>My life</h1>
        <p>Now this wouldn't be a recipe site without going into too much detail about the author's life, so here we are.</p>
        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
        <p>I have two older sisters, and one of them is much more experienced with cooking and experimenting with unique flavors. 
            I have grown up loving to draw, play video games, and bake instead. 
            From simple cookies to complex macarons, I feel secure in the precise calculations of baking, as opposed to the improvisational environment of cooking.
            Despite this, I still appreciate the art of cooking and treasure the love put into homecooked meals. 
        </p>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>Although I still don't consider myself a chef, memories with food are still a huge part of my life. 
            I still reminisce about food tours in Los Angeles with friends, watch Ratatouille more times then I can count, and play Overcooked with my family. 
            For this Thanksgiving, I went out of my comfort zone and made the cheesiest macaroni casserole possible. And it was delicious. 
            I really hope to experiment more with cooking, but until then, enjoy this website highlighting my novice coding capabilities!
        </p>
